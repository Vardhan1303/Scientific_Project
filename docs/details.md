## Key Features

### 1. Camera Calibration
Uses a checkerboard pattern to estimate intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters, ensuring precise image correction.

#### Calibration Setup
- **Checkerboard Size:** 100 mm by 100 mm.
- **Square Size:** 10 mm by 10 mm.
- **Number of Inner Corners:** 9 x 9.

#### Image Acquisition
Images of the checkerboard were captured from various angles and distances to ensure robust calibration. This approach minimizes errors from noise, lighting variations, or lens distortions.

#### Camera Calibration Process
The calibration process uses OpenCV algorithms, guided by official documentation and supplementary tutorials. Results include:
- **Intrinsic Matrix (K):** Defines the camera's internal parameters.
- **Extrinsic Parameters (R, T):** Describes the camera's rotation and translation relative to the world coordinate system.
- **Distortion Coefficients:** Corrects radial and tangential lens distortions.

### 2. Marker Detection
Employs OpenCV’s ArUco library for marker generation and tracking.

#### Marker Generation
- **Using Python:**
  - Dictionary: `aruco.DICT_6X6_50`
  - Marker ID: 13
  - Size: 500 pixels.
- **Online Tools:** Simplifies marker generation with customizable dictionary and size options.

#### Marker Detection
- **Algorithms:**
  - Uses calibrated parameters for lens distortion correction.
  - Detects markers via `cv2.aruco.detectMarkers()`.
  - Highlights markers in frames using `cv2.aruco.drawDetectedMarkers()`.
- **Pose Estimation:**
  - Calculates position and orientation relative to the camera using `cv2.solvePnP()`.

### 3. Distance Estimation
Determines the distance to markers using pose estimation.

#### Methodology
- **Translation Vector (tvec):** Extracts depth (tz) from pose estimation.
- **Single Marker Calculation:**
```python
def calculate_distance(tvec):
    distance_meters = tvec[0][0][2]
    distance_cm = distance_meters * 100
    return distance_cm
```
- **Multi-Marker Calculation:** Computes the centroid and distances for up to three markers to maintain consistent tracking during turns.

#### Accuracy Evaluation
- **Metrics:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Error Percentage.
- **Performance:** Achieved an average error of less than 2 cm, demonstrating high accuracy.

### 4. Movement Control
Adjusts motor speeds dynamically to maintain alignment and distance.

#### Motor Control Functionality
- **Forward and Backward Movement:** Adjusts based on proximity to the lead vehicle.
- **Lateral Corrections:** Modifies motor speeds to correct deviations.
- **Stopping:** Halts the robot within a 5 cm threshold of the desired distance.

#### Kalman Filter Integration
- **Purpose:** Filters noisy measurements for refined distance and deviation estimates.
- **Implementation:** Provides inputs for precise motor adjustments, ensuring smooth operation.

#### Handling Marker Loss
- **Strategy:**
  - Uses the last known lateral deviation to initiate a slight rotation.
  - Implements a timeout mechanism to prevent continuous rotation.
- **Recovery:** Resumes normal operation upon re-detection of the marker.
